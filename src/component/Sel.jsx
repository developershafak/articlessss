                            <p className='mb-[20px] p-[10px] '>aylor Swift is your best friend, and my best friend, and millions of other fans’ best friends. She’s created a cult following of millions of people, harnessing the power of parasociality to sell countless records and tickets. Anyone that writes about Taylor includes several references to her lyrics, and probably some allusions to her personal life too, leaving easter eggs mirroring Taylor’s own love of callbacks. Her music is modern folklore,
                                not just for her way with storytelling, but for its ubiquity, permeating every facet of pop culture.</p>
                            <p className='pb-[30px] mt-[20px]'>Last October, Taylor Swift released her re-recorded version of 1989, still her most popular album to date. It’s still a great, if exceptionally frontloaded album, but one nearly impossible to recreate. 1989 superproducer Max Martin isn’t on board, so it’s up to her long-time engineer Christopher Rowe to craft soundalikes. Like the other pop-era re-records, it’s fascinating, but ultimately diminishing returns; they often sound like cheap karaoke recreations.</p>
                            <p className='pb-[30px] mt-[20px]'>But I’m not interested in talking about the technicalities of the re-records. Here, I’m interested in what happened when the new 1989 “prologue” leaked. Before every Taylor’s Version album, she reflects on her life at the time of release. This prologue denigrated anyone speculating about her relationships (a frequent theme), but she saved specific cynicism for those speculating about her relationships with other women:</p>
                            <p className='pb-[30px] mt-[20px] font-source-serif-pro, Georgia, Cambria, "Times New Roman", Times, serif'>Being a consummate optimist, I assumed I could fix [their speculation] if I simply changed my behavior. I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn’t sensationalize or sexualize that — right? I would learn later on that people could and people would..</p>
                            <p className='pb-[30px] mt-[20px]'>It was uncharacteristically bitter, righteous toward paparazzi but implicitly condemning anyone who thought she might be queer Later, she talks about the “seeds of her allyship” being planted with the clumsy “boys-and-boys-and-girls-and-girls” line in “Welcome To New York.” In a sense, this is her reacting to her own fame as much as it is directed at any specific person, looking upon her parasocial empire and fearing what it’s become. But for anyone who thought she was like them, this was devastating.
                            </p>
                            ...
                            <p className='pb-[30px] mt-[20px]'>I don’t know if there’s a way she could have done this nicely, other than going to every Swiftie individually, caressing their face, and saying “I’m straight, but I still love and care about you.” For years, there’s been an ongoing movement of Gaylors, people who think Taylor Swift is either closeted or has already come out through her music. Sometimes, these are straight fans, sometimes these are queer fans sharing their interpretations of songs, and sometimes, it’s people who wonder what really happened with her and certain other female celebrities. There’s a reason for that investment: to Gaylors, Taylor being queer could potentially change the world, ushering in greater LGBTQ acceptance,
                                confirming that gay stories are being told on the biggest stages possible.</p>
                            <p className='pb-[30px] mt-[20px]'>Maybe my old dreams are just that, dreams. I’d had my shot and taken the wrong path. I was starting over in every area of my life—finances, health…love. Wasn’t it too much to expect to restart my education, too?</p>
                            <p className='pb-[30px] mt-[20px]'>After the prologue leaked, I was going to leave it alone. Then The New York Times article happened. “Look What We Made Taylor Swift Do” is a 5,000 word Hail Mary for Gaylors, one I commend for not mentioning her love interests (or ‘muses’, as the subreddit calls them) by name, but one that, in its willful misinterpretation of lyrics, mistakes speculation for fact. According to CNN, Taylor Swift’s team was furious at the transgressed boundaries. And in a lot of ways, it is indeed difficult — look at Billie Eilish, who had to confirm her queerness because accusations of ‘queerbaiting’ were getting too intense.</p>

                            <p className='pb-[30px] mt-[20px]'>With that report, an unsettling number of people were celebrating the impending death of Gaylorism — she was straight the whole time, those gays can stop being so nosy! People who can’t express their identity often did through talking about and participating in Gaylor conversation — and they’re watching their lifeline slip away. Sure, there’s other other queer art, but in the mainstream, it’s often too tasteful to resonate like Taylor’s messiness.</p>
                            <p className='pb-[30px] mt-[20px]'>For many queer Gaylors, the palpably angry rejection of Taylor Swift and her team likely brings up painful memories of unrequited crushes, of being deeply in love with your best friend and realizing they don’t and won’t feel the same. The delusion shatters, as it finally registers they never cared about you like you did about them. It was the song and dance every queer woman plays on a massive, conspiratorial scale. It hits different because it’s her.
